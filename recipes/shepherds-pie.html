     <h2>No-fuss shepherd's pie</h2>
        <h3>We've got some lovely twists on shepherd's pie on the site, but 
            we were missing a definitive version of this classic family 
            recipe – here it is! </h3>    
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2-3 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>500g lamb mince</li>
                <li>2 tbps tomato puree</li>
                <li>large splash Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>500ml beef stock</li>
                <li>900g grams potatoes, cut into chunks</li>
                <li>85g butter</li>
                <li>3 tbsp milk</li>
            </ul>  
       <h4>Method:</h4>
       <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil in a medium saucepan,
            then soften 1 chopped onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for a few mins.</li>
        <li>When soft, turn up the heat,
            crumble in 500g lamb mince and brown, tipping off any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp tomato purée and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce,
            then fry for a few mins.</li>
        <li>Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer,
            then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the mash. 
            Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender.
            Drain, then mash with 85g butter and 3 tbsp milk.</li>
        <li>Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. 
            The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges.
            (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre.
            Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)</li>
        <li>Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.</li>
        </ol>
